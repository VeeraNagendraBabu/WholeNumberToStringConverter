# Whole Number To String Converter

This simple takes whole number as string input and returns back International number system string

# Introduction

These instructions will make you run test cases and get the desired output mentioned above. This project is build in .NET Standarded 2.0 and Nunit Framework.
I have created three projects in this solution.
 - .Net Console Library.
 - .Net Class Library.
 - Nunit Test project.
 
As a Test driven apporach, I have created Class Library project for building core converter and used it Console application and NUnit projects.

In the interst of time, I have used .net Standarded 2.0 class library solution but if i have enough time, then I would have extended the logic to print numbers beyond Trillion numbers
